# Built-in Auth for Azure App Service with Entra ID

This repository includes all the Bicep (infrastructure-as-code) necessary to provision an Azure App Service app with the [built-in authentication feature](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/overview-authentication-authorization) and a Microsoft Entra ID identity provider. The Bicep files use the new [Microsoft Graph extension (public preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/templates/overview-bicep-templates-for-graph) to create the Entra application registration using [managed identity with Federated Identity Credentials](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/overview-managed-identity), so that no client secrets or certificates are necessary.

## Getting started

You have a few options for getting started with this template.
The quickest way to get started is GitHub Codespaces, since it will setup all the tools for you, but you can also [set it up locally](#local-environment).

### GitHub Codespaces

You can run this template virtually by using GitHub Codespaces. The button will open a web-based VS Code instance in your browser:

1. Open the template (this may take several minutes):

    [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/Azure-Samples/appservice-builtinauth-bicep)

2. Open a terminal window
3. Continue with the [deploying steps](#deploying)

### VS Code Dev Containers

A related option is VS Code Dev Containers, which will open the project in your local VS Code using the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers):

1. Start Docker Desktop (install it if not already installed)
2. Open the project:

    [![Open in Dev Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=Dev%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/Azure-Samples/appservice-builtinauth-bicep)

3. In the VS Code window that opens, once the project files show up (this may take several minutes), open a terminal window.
4. Continue with the [deploying steps](#deploying)

### Local environment

If you're not using one of the above options for opening the project, then you'll need to:

1. Make sure the following tools are installed:

    * [Azure Developer CLI (azd) 1.12+](https://aka.ms/install-azd)
    * [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/): Only needed for local development.
    * [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

2. Download the project code:

    ```shell
    azd init -t appservice-builtinauth-bicep
    ```

3. Open the project folder in your terminal or editor.

4. Continue with the [deploying steps](#deploying).

## Deploying

Once you've opened the project in [Codespaces](#github-codespaces), in [Dev Containers](#vs-code-dev-containers), or [locally](#local-environment), you can deploy it to Azure.

Steps for deployment:

1. Sign up for a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) and create an Azure subscription.
2. Login to Azure:

    ```shell
    azd auth login
    ```

3. _(Optional)_ If you'd like to use the free SKU instead of the basic SKU, run:

    ```shell
    azd env set USE_FREE_SKU true
    ```

4. Provision and deploy all the resources:

    ```shell
    azd up
    ```

    It will prompt you to login and to provide a name (like "authapp") and location (like "eastus"). Then it will provision the resources in your account and deploy the latest code.

5. When `azd` has finished deploying, you'll see an endpoint URI in the command output. Visit that URI, and you should see the front page of the app! 🎉 If you see an error, open the Azure Portal from the URL in the command output, navigate to the App Service, select Logstream, and check the logs for any errors.

## Costs

Pricing varies per region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage. You can try the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/) for the resources:

* Azure App Service: Basic Tier with 1 CPU core, 1.75 GB RAM. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/linux/)
* Microsoft Entra: Free for up to 50,000 monthly active users. [Pricing](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/microsoft-entra-pricing)

⚠️ To reduce unnecessary costs, remember to take down your app if it's no longer in use,
either by deleting the resource group in the Portal or running `azd down`.

## Local development

The built-in auth feature is only available when the app is deployed to Azure App Service. However, you can run the app locally to test the app's functionality.

1. Create a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments) and activate it.

2. Install requirements:

    ```shell
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the server:

    ```shell
    python3 -m flask run --port 50505 --debug
    ```

4. Click 'http://127.0.0.1:50505' in the terminal, which should open the website in a new tab.
5. Try the index page, try '/hello?name=yourname', and try other paths.
