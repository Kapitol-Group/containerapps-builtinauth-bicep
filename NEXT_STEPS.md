# 🎯 Next Steps - SharePoint FilePicker Implementation

## Current Status: ✅ Code Complete, ⏳ Dependencies Needed

All code has been implemented! You just need to install dependencies to resolve TypeScript errors.

---

## 🚨 Action Required

### Step 1: Install Dependencies (Required to fix errors)

Run this command:

```bash
./install-sharepoint-deps.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install @azure/msal-react @azure/msal-browser uuid
npm install --save-dev @types/uuid
cd ..
```

**This will fix all TypeScript errors you're seeing.**

---

## 📋 Full Deployment Process

### Option A: Automated (Recommended)

```bash
./setup-sharepoint-complete.sh
```

This will:
1. ✅ Install npm dependencies
2. ✅ Run first deployment (`azd up`)
3. ✅ Extract and configure Client ID
4. ✅ Prompt for SharePoint URL
5. ✅ Run second deployment (`azd deploy`)

### Option B: Manual Steps

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
./install-sharepoint-deps.sh

# 2. First deployment (creates Entra app)
azd up

# 3. Get configuration values
azd env get-values

# 4. Set build-time environment variables
azd env set VITE_ENTRA_CLIENT_ID "<from-ENTRA_CLIENT_ID-output>"
azd env set VITE_ENTRA_TENANT_ID "<from-ENTRA_TENANT_ID-output>"
azd env set VITE_SHAREPOINT_BASE_URL "https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com"

# 5. Second deployment (rebuilds with config)
azd deploy

# 6. Grant admin consent in Azure Portal
# Go to: Azure Portal → Entra ID → App Registrations → Your App → API Permissions → Grant admin consent
```

---

## 🔍 Verify Installation

After running `./install-sharepoint-deps.sh`, check:

```bash
cd frontend
npm list @azure/msal-react @azure/msal-browser uuid
```

Should show:
```
├── @azure/msal-browser@3.x.x
├── @azure/msal-react@2.x.x
└── uuid@10.x.x
```

---

## 📝 TypeScript Errors (Before Dependencies)

You'll see these errors until dependencies are installed:

```
❌ Cannot find module '@azure/msal-browser'
❌ Cannot find module '@azure/msal-react'
❌ Cannot find module 'uuid'
```

**After running `./install-sharepoint-deps.sh`:**
```
✅ All TypeScript errors resolved
✅ Ready to deploy
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Read `CONTAINER_APP_ENV_VARS.md`** - Explains why two deployments are needed
2. **Use automated script** - Handles everything for you
3. **Keep SharePoint URL handy** - You'll need it during setup
4. **Grant admin consent early** - Avoids permission errors later

---

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

1. Check TypeScript errors → Run `./install-sharepoint-deps.sh`
2. Check deployment errors → Review Bicep output
3. Check runtime errors → Browser console + Azure logs
4. Check auth errors → Verify admin consent granted

**All troubleshooting details in documentation!**
