# ✅ SharePoint FilePicker Integration - Complete Implementation

## 🎯 Summary

The SharePoint FilePicker has been successfully integrated into the `CreateTenderModal` component, allowing users to browse and select SharePoint folders for tender paths and output locations.

---

## 📋 What Was Done

### 1. **New Components & Configuration**

#### Frontend Files Created:
- ✅ `frontend/src/authConfig.ts` - MSAL authentication configuration
- ✅ `frontend/src/components/SharePointFilePicker.tsx` - Reusable picker component
- ✅ `frontend/.env.local.example` - Environment variable template

#### Infrastructure Updates:
- ✅ `Dockerfile` - Updated with Vite build arguments
- ✅ `infra/appregistration.bicep` - Added SharePoint permissions (`Files.Read.All`, `Sites.Read.All`)
- ✅ `infra/main.bicep` - Added outputs for `ENTRA_CLIENT_ID` and `ENTRA_TENANT_ID`

#### Modified Components:
- ✅ `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Added MSAL provider wrapper
- ✅ `frontend/src/components/CreateTenderModal.tsx` - Integrated SharePoint pickers
- ✅ `frontend/src/vite-env.d.ts` - Added TypeScript types for env vars

#### Documentation:
- ✅ `SHAREPOINT_FILEPICKER_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Detailed technical guide
- ✅ `SHAREPOINT_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Implementation overview
- ✅ `CONTAINER_APP_ENV_VARS.md` - **Critical** - Explains build-time vs runtime vars
- ✅ `QUICKSTART_SHAREPOINT.md` - Quick reference guide
- ✅ `README_SHAREPOINT_COMPLETE.md` - This file

#### Scripts:
- ✅ `install-sharepoint-deps.sh` - Installs npm dependencies
- ✅ `setup-sharepoint-complete.sh` - **Complete automated setup**

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option A: Automated Setup (Recommended)

```bash
./setup-sharepoint-complete.sh
```

This script will:
1. Install all npm dependencies
2. Run first deployment (`azd up`)
3. Extract Client ID and Tenant ID
4. Prompt for SharePoint URL
5. Set environment variables
6. Run second deployment (`azd deploy`)

### Option B: Manual Setup

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
./install-sharepoint-deps.sh

# 2. First deployment
azd up

# 3. Configure environment
azd env get-values | grep ENTRA
azd env set VITE_ENTRA_CLIENT_ID "<client-id>"
azd env set VITE_ENTRA_TENANT_ID "<tenant-id>"
azd env set VITE_SHAREPOINT_BASE_URL "https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com"

# 4. Second deployment (rebuild with config)
azd deploy
```

## 🔑 Key Concept: Build-Time vs Runtime Variables

### ⚠️ Critical Understanding

**Vite environment variables (`VITE_*`) are BUILD-TIME variables:**

- ✅ Must be set BEFORE Docker build
- ✅ Compiled into JavaScript bundle
- ✅ Cannot be changed after build
- ❌ Setting as container env vars won't work

**Backend variables are RUNTIME variables:**

- ✅ Set in `infra/aca.bicep`
- ✅ Can be changed without rebuild
- ✅ Read when Flask app starts

### Why Two Deployments?

```
First Deployment (azd up)
    └─> Creates Entra App Registration
        └─> Outputs ENTRA_CLIENT_ID

        ↓ Set build args ↓
        
Second Deployment (azd deploy)
    └─> Rebuilds Docker image
        └─> Frontend compiled with ENTRA_CLIENT_ID
            └─> SharePoint picker works! 🎉
```

**See `CONTAINER_APP_ENV_VARS.md` for complete explanation.**

## 📦 Dependencies

The following npm packages are required:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@azure/msal-react": "^2.x.x",
    "@azure/msal-browser": "^3.x.x",
    "uuid": "^10.x.x"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/uuid": "^10.x.x"
  }
}
```

Install with: `./install-sharepoint-deps.sh` or manually via `npm install`

---

## 🔐 Required Azure Permissions

The Entra app registration needs these Microsoft Graph permissions (already configured in `infra/appregistration.bicep`):

| Permission | Type | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|
| `User.Read` | Delegated | Basic user profile |
| `Files.Read.All` | Delegated | Read SharePoint files |
| `Sites.Read.All` | Delegated | Access SharePoint sites |
| `offline_access` | Delegated | Refresh tokens |
| `openid` | Delegated | OpenID Connect |
| `profile` | Delegated | User profile info |

### Admin Consent

After deployment, an admin may need to grant consent:

1. Azure Portal → Entra ID → App Registrations
2. Find: "Tender Automation Client App"
3. API Permissions → Grant admin consent

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Local Development (Frontend Only)

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

**Note:** SharePoint picker won't work locally without proper Azure auth setup.

### Testing Deployed App

1. Get app URL: `azd env get-values | grep SERVICE_ACA_URI`
2. Visit the app and login
3. Click "Create New Tender"
4. Click "Browse" next to SharePoint Path
5. Authenticate if prompted
6. Select a folder
7. Verify path populates the input field

## 🎨 User Experience

### Before Implementation
```
[Tender Name        ]
[SharePoint Path    ] [Browse] ← Shows alert "Coming soon"
[Output Location    ]
```

### After Implementation
```
[Tender Name        ]
[SharePoint Path    ] [📁 Browse] ← Opens SharePoint picker
[Output Location    ] [📁 Browse] ← Opens SharePoint picker
```

### Picker Flow
1. Click "Browse" → Opens popup window
2. Shows SharePoint sites/folders
3. User selects folder
4. Path auto-fills in input field
5. Popup closes

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot find module '@azure/msal-browser'"

**Solution:**
```bash
./install-sharepoint-deps.sh
```

### Issue: "VITE_ENTRA_CLIENT_ID is undefined in browser"

**Solution:** Variables weren't set during build.
```bash
azd env set VITE_ENTRA_CLIENT_ID "<value>"
azd deploy  # Rebuild required
```

### Issue: "Failed to get delegated token"

**Solutions:**
1. Check client ID is correct: `azd env get-values`
2. Verify admin consent granted in Azure Portal
3. Check SharePoint URL is correct
4. Ensure user has SharePoint access

### Issue: Picker won't open

**Solutions:**
1. Allow popups for your site
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify MSAL is initialized: Check console for "MSAL initialized"

# Rebuild and redeploy
azd deploy
```

**Remember:** Vite variables require rebuild!
