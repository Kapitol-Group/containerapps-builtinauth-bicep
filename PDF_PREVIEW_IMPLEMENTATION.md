# PDF Preview Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a full-featured PDF preview functionality for the Tender Management application using `pdfjs-dist` library.

## Features Implemented

### 1. PDF Rendering
- Renders PDF files directly in the browser
- Uses Mozilla's PDF.js library (already in dependencies)
- Canvas-based rendering for high-quality display

### 2. Navigation Controls
- **Previous/Next Page**: Navigate through multi-page PDF documents
- **Page Counter**: Shows current page and total pages (e.g., "Page 1 of 5")
- **Disabled State**: Buttons are appropriately disabled at document boundaries

### 3. Zoom Controls
- **Zoom In**: Increase PDF scale up to 300%
- **Zoom Out**: Decrease PDF scale down to 50%
- **Reset Zoom**: Click the percentage button to reset to 100%
- **Current Scale Display**: Shows current zoom level as percentage

### 4. File Type Detection
- Automatically detects PDF files based on:
  - Content-Type header (`application/pdf`)
  - File extension (`.pdf`)
- Shows appropriate message for non-PDF files

### 5. Loading States
- Loading indicator while PDF is being fetched and rendered
- Error handling with user-friendly error messages
- Graceful fallback when no file is selected

## Technical Implementation

### Components Modified

#### `/frontend/src/components/FilePreview.tsx`
- Complete rewrite with PDF.js integration
- State management for page navigation and zoom
- Async PDF loading from blob storage
- Canvas-based rendering

#### `/frontend/src/pages/TenderManagementPage.tsx`
- Added `tenderId` prop to `FilePreview` component
- Enables file downloading for preview

#### `/frontend/src/components/FilePreview.css` (New)
- Responsive layout for preview panel
- Control button styling
- Canvas container with shadow effects
- Loading and error state styles

### Key Technologies
- **pdfjs-dist**: PDF rendering library
- **React Hooks**: useState, useEffect, useRef for state and lifecycle management
- **Canvas API**: For rendering PDF pages
- **Blob API**: For downloading files from backend

### Architecture Flow
```
User selects file
    ↓
FilePreview component receives file + tenderId
    ↓
Download file as Blob via filesApi.download()
    ↓
Convert Blob to ArrayBuffer
    ↓
Load PDF with pdfjs-dist
    ↓
Render page to Canvas element
    ↓
User can navigate/zoom, triggering re-render
```

## API Integration

Uses existing backend endpoint:
```
GET /api/tenders/{tenderId}/files/{file_path}
```

Returns file as binary blob with appropriate content-type header.

## Browser Compatibility

PDF.js is compatible with all modern browsers:
- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)

## Performance Considerations

- Lazy loading: Only downloads PDF when selected
- Single page rendering: Renders one page at a time
- Cleanup: Properly destroys PDF document when switching files
- CDN worker: Uses CDN for PDF.js worker thread

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. **Thumbnail sidebar**: Show all pages as thumbnails
2. **Text search**: Search within PDF content
3. **Annotations**: Allow users to mark up PDFs
4. **Print support**: Direct print from preview
5. **Download button**: Quick download of current file
6. **Rotate page**: Rotate current page view
7. **Fit to width/height**: Auto-scale options
8. **Multi-file preview**: Quick switch between files

## Testing

To test the PDF preview:
1. Deploy the application
2. Create a tender
3. Upload a PDF file
4. Click on the PDF file in the file browser
5. The preview panel should show:
   - PDF rendered on canvas
   - Page navigation controls (if multi-page)
   - Zoom controls

## Dependencies

Already included in `package.json`:
```json
"pdfjs-dist": "^5.4.296"
```

No additional installation required.
